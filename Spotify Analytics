--In this project, I downloaded Spotify data off of Kaggle.
--Next, I created a table to insert the data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

--Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

--I then inserted the Spotify data (.csv) into the table.
--Lastly, I explored the data using the following SQL.

--I determined the average danceability of the top ten most popular songs.
SELECT avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity IN (
    SELECT popularity
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity desc
    LIMIT 10)

--I found each artist's average danceability.
SELECT artist_name, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg(danceability) desc

--I displayed the names of all the collaborative songs in the data and which artists released them.
SELECT track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name like '%(with%'
    OR track_name like '%feat.%'

--I found which song had the highest energy and who released it.
SELECT track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 1
