       inv.InvoiceId, inv.CustomerId, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM employees empl
LEFT JOIN customers cust
    ON empl.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices inv
    ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE empl.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'

--3. What was the total revenue by country in 2012?
SELECT sum(Total), BillingCountry

SELECT t.GenreId, g.Name, count(*)
FROM tracks t
JOIN genres g
    ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
GROUP BY t.GenreId

--5. Which tracks were purchased the most?
SELECT t.Name, sum(Quantity)
FROM invoice_items ii
JOIN tracks t
    ON ii.TrackId = t.TrackId
GROUP BY ii.TrackId
HAVING sum(Quantity) =
    (SELECT sum(Quantity)
    FROM invoice_items
    GROUP BY TrackId
    ORDER BY sum(Quantity) DESC
    LIMIT 1)
